## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of an object detection system using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** algorithm with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Numpy**. YOLO is one of the most popular and efficient deep learning algorithms for real-time object detection, and this implementation allows detecting objects in both images and video streams.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Load and process images or video frames.
- Detect objects in real-time using YOLO.
- Draw bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.
  
## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3 or YOLOv4.
- Bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.
- Adjustable confidence thresholds.
- Detection in both images and video streams.
- Easy integration with OpenCV for video processing and visualization.

## Requirements
Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```
